## Introduction
This project was made for... 


## About the dataset
the dataset processed in this exercise is the MNIST dataset, formatted in CSV.
### Shape of the dataset
The dataset contains 29 columns and N lines divided into 2 files:
- mnist_train.csv (to train the dataset 60000 entries)
- mnist_test.csv (to test the dataset: 10 000 entries)
Each line represents an image of a digit.
The dataset contains a column for the label and 784 columns to represent the pixels data of the image.
